In Trade Confirm poll response 'level' is actually odds, this is confusing.

Without streamed OHU updates there seems to be no way to get sprint market payout.

We are not aware of the maximum stake we can place on a sprint market.

Ten second sprint markets allow for an enormous amount of ideas to be realised. We suggest adding them to API.

The arguments returned in the LS onSubscriptionError callback are not useful.

The error response keys seem to be pretty helpful this time round. We ended up making the following dictionary for common errors:

	var dictionary = {
		"errorsprintmarketcreate-positionmarket-closed": "Error: Market closed",
		"errorsprintmarketcreate-positionorder-sizeinvalid": "Error: Order size invalid",
		"errorpublic-apiexceeded-account-historical-data-allowance": "API Error: Historical Data Allowance exceeded"
	}

It would be nice if we didn't have to include this step, but we were able to achieve friendly response by adding them ourselves.
